Solutions for two tasks from Huawei CodeCraft competition, Sep-Oct 2017:

1. Geometric shaping. The objective is to find the 16-point (and later 64-point) signal constellation which maximizes the channel capacity under the power constraint. We used the genetic optimization algorithm which is called differential evolution
2. Filter quantization. The objective is to find integer coefficients of a digital filter that are close to given real-valued ones so that the filter remains stable. Again, differential evolution works decently
